//  Write a program that uses a structure to store the following weather data for a
//  particular month:
//
//      Total Rainfall
//      High Temperature
//      Low Temperature
//      Average Temperature
//
//  The program should have an array of 12 structures to hold weather data for an entire
//  year. When the program runs, it should ask the user to enter data for each month.
//  (The average temperature should be calculated.) Once the data are entered for all the
//  months, the program should calculate and display the average monthly rainfall, the
//  total rainfall for the year, the highest and lowest temperatures for the year (and the
//  months they occurred in), and the average of all the monthly temperatures.
//
//  Input Validation: Only accept temperatures within the range between -100 and +140
//  degrees Fahrenheit.
